To analyze a natural phenomenon in general or an engineering problem in particular, we often have to develop a mathematical model that can describe the problem in question as reliably as possible. The method of elements finite is one of the most powerful digital techniques. Concretely, this allows for example to numerically calculate the behavior even very complex objects. Thus, any complex shape of a geometric domain or a problem that is well-posed with all the boundary conditions, can be solved by the finite element method.
